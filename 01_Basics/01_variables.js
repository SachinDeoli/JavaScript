// we can define a variable in 3 different ways using const, let, var, and with no keyword.
// const keyword -: value cannot be changed if defined once,if tried changing it will give runtime error.
// let keyword -: used to define the a vairable , for efficient coding weshould use let.
// var keyword-: used to define the a vairable, it was used earlier, now for efficient coding practise we use let not var keywoed
         // Variables declared by let are only available inside the block where they’re defined.
         // Variables declared by var are available throughout the function in which they’re declared.
// var4 ="hi" -: we can define a variable like this too but it is also not a good coding practise.
